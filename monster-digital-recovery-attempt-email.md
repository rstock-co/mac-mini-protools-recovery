**Subject:** Monster Digital Drive - Recovery Attempt Update

---

Hi Jason,

I attempted to recover data from the Monster Digital Overdrive (240GB) today. Unfortunately, when we connected the drive to the Mac Mini using the available cable and adapter, the drive showed no signs of life at all — no lights, no spinning, and the computer didn't detect it. The Mac's system showed no record of any new USB device being connected.

This suggests the drive has a complete hardware failure, either in the internal electronics, the power circuitry, or possibly the USB interface. Unlike the WD drive which at least powered on and was recognized by the computer, this drive isn't responding at all. Without power reaching the drive, there's no way for software tools to access or scan it.

The options for this drive are more limited. If you have a different USB cable with the correct connector (USB-B square type), it would be worth trying that to rule out a cable issue. Otherwise, the only path forward would be professional data recovery, where they can open the drive and attempt to read the storage chips or platters directly. For an SSD like this one, that type of recovery typically runs $500 or more with no guarantee of success.

Let me know if you'd like to try a different cable, or if you have any questions about the recovery options.
